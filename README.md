Project Proposal
Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Logistic Regression
________________________________________
Problem Statement:
Credit card fraud has become a major issue for financial institutions and customers worldwide. Fraudulent transactions cause significant financial losses and erode trust in digital payment systems. Detecting these fraudulent transactions in real time is challenging because fraudulent cases are rare compared to legitimate ones, leading to highly imbalanced data.
________________________________________
Objectives:
•	To identify fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning.
•	To analyze transaction data patterns and correlations among features.
•	To handle data imbalance using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
•	To train and evaluate a Logistic Regression model for classifying transactions as “Fraud” or “Not Fraud.”
•	To assess the model’s performance using key evaluation metrics.

Dataset Description:
•	Source: credit_card_fraud_dataset.csv (local dataset path used in notebook).
•	Size: Not explicitly stated in the notebook, but typically several thousand records.
•	Key Features:
o	TransactionID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
o	Amount: The amount of money transacted.
o	TransactionType: Type of transaction (encoded using LabelEncoder).
o	Location: The location where the transaction occurred (encoded).
o	TransactionDate: Date and time of the transaction.
o	IsFraud: Target variable (1 = Fraudulent, 0 = Legitimate).
•	Derived Features:
o	TransactionHour, TransactionDay, TransactionMonth — extracted from TransactionDate.

Model Evaluation
Model Used:
•	Logistic Regression
Evaluation Metrics:
After training and prediction, the model was evaluated using the following metrics (commonly applied to fraud detection problems):
•	Accuracy
•	Precision
•	Recall
•	F1-Score
•	ROC-AUC
(Exact numerical results aren’t shown in your notebook, but this section should include them once the model runs successfully.)
________________________________________
Interpretation and Discussion:
•	High Accuracy alone may be misleading due to data imbalance (many more non-fraud than fraud cases).
•	Precision and Recall are more reliable indicators:
o	High recall indicates the model detects most fraudulent transactions.
o	High precision means fewer false fraud alerts.
•	The ROC-AUC value helps visualize the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.
•	After applying SMOTE, the model should perform better in detecting minority (fraud) cases.

Conclusion and Recommendations
Key Insights:
•	Logistic Regression can effectively classify transactions with proper feature engineering and resampling.
•	The features Amount, TransactionType, and TransactionHour seem to have notable influence on fraud likelihood.
•	Imbalanced data handling (via SMOTE) significantly improves model recall for fraud detection.
________________________________________
Limitations:
•	Logistic Regression assumes linear separability, which may not capture complex fraud patterns.
•	Data imbalance can still influence model generalization.
•	Missing or inconsistent timestamps may reduce data quality.
________________________________________
Future Improvements:
•	Use advanced algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks for better accuracy.
•	Include more behavioral and time-based features (e.g., transaction frequency).
•	Deploy the model as an API or integrate it into a fraud detection dashboard.
•	Implement cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
